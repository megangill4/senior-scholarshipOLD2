## Molecular Orbitals

Now that we have displayed atomic orbitals, we can start to consider molecular orbitals. Much like atomic orbitals, molecular orbitals are described by wavefunctions, and are constructed by finding the linear combination of atomic orbitals from different atoms. Similarly to atomic orbitals, we can find the probability density of an electron at each point in the molecular orbital by taking the square modulus of the wavefunction. Bonding orbitals are lower in energy than the atomic orbitals that form them, while antibonding orbitals are higher in energy. Filling an antibonding orbital effectively cancels out the bond formed by filling the bonding orbital. 

Conjugated compounds contain both sigma bonds (single bonds formed from the head on overlap of any orbital) and π bonds (double bonds formed from the side on overlap of p orbitals). For this project, I have chosen to focus on π bonds as it is π bonding that gives conjugated compounds their interesting properties. The simplest organic molecule containing a π bond is ethene:
