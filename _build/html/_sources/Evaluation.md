# Evaluation

I started this project before the senior scholarship was introduced, originally intending to program plots of only atomic orbitals, with the sole intent of furthering my understanding of orbitals. Every piece of chemistry literature I came across seemed to contain computed plots of molecular orbitals, with little to no explanation of how the diagrams had been constructed. This left me frustrated, and motivated to learn the theory necessary to create my own graphs of molecular orbitals. Reading about conjugation in ‘Why chemical reactions happen’, and subsequently exploring the topic in Chemistry Geek club at school fascinated me, prompting me to expand my computer program to include conjugated molecular orbitals. The overall aim of my project is to use a central idea (a python program utilizing Hückel MO theory) to explain varied properties of conjugated compounds.

The most challenging aspect of the project was adding heteroatoms to the conjugated systems. While many physical chemistry texts explain Hückel theory for hydrocarbons, I was not able to find a general text (or YouTube video) that included heteroatoms, and had to look to a more specific book. I was unable to find any projects similar to my own online, and certainly none containing that considered heteroatoms. While I was excited to produce an original program, it was difficult to find information on how to translate Hückel theory into a computer program. 

My programs could be adapted to execute calculations on a broad range of conjugated molecules, and as a result, I struggled with narrowing down content for the final write up. Originally I wanted to include a calculation of the wavelengths of light absorbed by a longer polyene, as well some scatter plots of molecular orbitals produced by using the Metropolis-Hastings method. I found it difficult to explain the results of my programs without simply paraphrasing textbooks I had been using.

I chose to present my Senior Scholarship as a website as I found this to be the easiest way of displaying executed code blocks. Building the website, while daunting at first, was a valuable skill to learn. Before starting this project, I had never used python for scientific purposes, and considering the lack of similar projects available on the internet, I am happy with the programs I was able to produce.
