# Introduction

Understanding the bonding in chemical compounds enables the prediction of reactions and properties of different molecules. Conjugated organic compounds, typically represented as containing alternating single and double bonds, in particular display interesting properties. In fact, the double bonds spread out across the entire molecule, drastically altering the reactions of these compounds. This project aims to investigate the molecular orbitals of conjugated compounds in order to understand their bonding and unique properties. To display 3D graphs of these molecular orbitals, I have used python programming and HÃ¼ckel Molecular Orbital theory. I have chosen to focus on four molecules in particular; namely benzene, prop-2-enal, methoyl chloride and methanamide; explaining a range of properties from stability to reactivity using one central idea.
