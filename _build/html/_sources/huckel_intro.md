# Hückel Molecular Orbital theory for conjugated compounds

Hückel MO theory, while belonging to the days of pen and paper calculations due to its severe approximations, is still useful due to the relative simplicity and intuitive nature of the theory[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1). Hückel theory aims to calculate the energy and coefficients of π molecular orbitals for conjugated compounds.

Assumptions in Hückel MO theory[<sup>2</sup>](#fn2):
- The molecular orbital wave function for the conjugated system is constructed from a linear combination of p orbitals in the conjugated system. 
- All overlap integrals are set to zero
- For systems containing only carbon atoms, all coulomb integrals ($H_{ii}$) are set equal to α
- All resonance integrals between non-neighbours are set equal to zero
- All resonance integrals between neighbours ($H_{ij}$) are set to β (this only applies to hydrocarbons)
